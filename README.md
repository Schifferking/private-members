# Private-events

This project is about a site that lets users create and attend events.<br>
It will also contain a page to view all the events and each event separately. <br>
Each event page will contain a list of the attendees and each user page will contain a list of the events that will attend.<br>
Futhermore, any user can indicate the events it will want to attend.<br>
As an extra, it will have links to ease the site navigation. The users can edit and delete events they created. Any user can remove themselves from their
"attended events". And lastly, each event is private and the creator invites specific users to their events.<br>
